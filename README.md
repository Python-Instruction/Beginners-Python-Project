## number guessing game.py
### 1. Number Guessing – This is a simple yet exciting idea. You can even call it a mini-game. Make a program in which the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 to 9 range. Then give users a hint to guess the number. Every time the user guesses wrong, he gets another clue, and his score gets reduced. The clue can be multiples, divisible, greater or smaller, or a combination of all.

## dice_rolling.py
### 2.Dice Rolling Simulator – As the name of the program suggests, we will be imitating a rolling dice. The program will generate a random number each dice the program runs, and the users can use the dice repeatedly for as long as he wants.

## binary_search.py

### 3.Binary search algorithm – Have you ever heard the proverb, “finding a needle in a haystack.” This program is designed to do just that- by using a binary search algorithm. The idea behind this project is to create and implement an algorithm that searches for an element in a list.
